What is my project:

My project is an educational game in which a player builds a gear train for a toy car.
The player will be given the speed, direction, and location of the input and output axles.
The player must build a gear train that satisfies the requirements.
The player will learn the physics of gear trains.


How to run:

The main file that runs my game is called “GeaRaceRun.py”
To run the game, you need the following five python files and two images in the same directory. They are all included in the zip file. 

Five files:
- eventBasedAnimation.py
- GeaRaceManage.py
- GeaRaceMenu.py
- GeaRaceGame.py
- GeaRaceCustomize.py

Two images:
- GeaRace.gif
- trashcan.gif

Once you have all the files in the same directory (8 in total including the main file), you simply need to open the main file called “GeaRaceRun.py” and run it.

NOTE: Every time you create an account, an account will be created. In addition, a score file will be created for each user.
